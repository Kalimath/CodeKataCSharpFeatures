Try to implement the validation method for Type 7 Belgian numberplates.

Acceptance criteria:

- try to re-use as much existing fuctions (you can find them in the static StringValidators class)
- Name new String-functions in a way that they are reusable in another context

Tips:

- check BasicBelgianNumberplateType.cs for the format of a valid plate
- a first function to implement could be: FirstCharIsAlphaOrNumber
